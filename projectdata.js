        projectTitle: "My Personal Page",
        brief: "Build a text-based personal website. Side-quest was to 1) include an image, background pattern, video or sound and 2) add a subpage linked from the main page and vice versa. Included in the fundamentals module - frist brief of Hyper Island. ",
        time: "2 weeks.",
        goals: "To get the fundamental understanding and comfortability of writing HTML and CSS and challange myself to practice JavaScript on my own in preparation for the upcoming brief. My focus was to really understand the display and position properties.",
        role: "This was a solo-project, which means I did everything on my own.",
        solution: "I played around with many different things like animations, prototyping, fonts and basic JavaScript. It was a good first brief to get into the process of how to structure a project.",
        challanges: "Since this was the first project I went in to completely on my own it was a challange to know exactly what to prioritize and where to focus. I also have a tendency to not take a break if I get stuck, which in most cases leads to frustration and the problem not being solved.",
        learning1: "If(stuck){takeBreak()}",
        learning2: "Use let or const instead of var",
        learning3: "Write down your learnings to realize you are making progress",
        learning4: "Make a list of must-haves and nice-to-haves to keep you focusing on the right things",
        learning5: "To explain something to someone else is a great way of putting something in words and to simplify it to yourself",

        projectTitle: "Snake",
        brief: "Make an interactive website using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. We were not allowed to use frameworks or external API's, and we did not have to support mobile. Included in the fundamentals module - second brief of Hyper Island. ",
        time: "3 weeks.",
        goals: "The most important thing for me was to practice to come up with the logic myself and break down a problem instead of following a turtorial. I also wanted to feel more comfortable and gain some confidence in general with programming.",
        role: "This was a solo-project, which means I did everything on my own.",
        solution: "I decided to create a snake-game to get me into the strechzone but not into the danger zone. To reach my goal I started with making a flowchart with the game-logic and as challanges came along I developed that flowchart to break down problems further. I also developed my flowchart when I reached the point of adding some of my nice-to-haves like a highscore-board.",
        challanges: "I had some issues with the logic of how to make the snake grow when it hit the food, to begin with I accidently created a stick-game instead of the snake game.",
        learning1: "Confidence that I can break down a problem myself without a turtorial",
        learning2: "Deeper understanding of objects, arrays and objects within arrays",
        learning3: "The basics of canvas",
        learning4: "Different event listeners (keydown, input and click)",

        projectTitle: "ROTA - Habit Tracker",
        brief: "Build a habit tracker using vanilla JavaScript. Included in the if this then that module - third brief of Hyper Island. ",
        time: "3 weeks.",
        goals: "Learn how to work in groups with code, learn git, learn how to organize problems and break down tasks and also learn about storage.",
        role: "Since this was our first team-brief, no client was invlolved and we all wanted to learn it all we decided to do everything together. Everything from prototyping to writing code is done together through mob-coding.",
        solution: "We decided we wanted to give the user some sort of visual feedback when a goal was reached, which resulted in the concept ROTA. Every habit creates a plant and when a weekly-goal is reached that plant shall grow. We also wanted an overview page showing how far the user has left until deadline. Due to time we did not finish all features, so currently it's a daily tracker.",
        challanges: "We decided to do everything together and mob-code the whole project we knew from the beginning that it wasn't going to be the most effective approach. We still feel like it was worth it since we learned so much from eachother, but since it took more time we did not have enough time to finish all of our ideas and going forward we will have to divide the tasks to be more effective.",
        learning1: "Time management: count in time for unexpected and unpredictable problems",
        learning2: "Git, GitHub and Figma",
        learning3: "Mob-coding: dare to take coding initiatives",

        brief: "Build a website using one or more API's, have loading and error states in mind. Included in the if this then that module - fifth brief of Hyper Island.",
        time: "3 weeks.",
        goals: "Create a good team spirit and learning environment, get a better understanding of asynchronous functions, promises and API's, understand what Gatsby is and when to use it.",
        role: "Since we made a one page project it was hard for us to divide the tasks, the whole project is therefor mob-coded.",
        solution: "We decided to make a webpage with an overview of our whole class based on the GitHub API. We fetched every persons public repositories and the languages used so that we could calculate a percentage of everyone's experiences. The website is first of all meant to be a resource for our class so that you know who to ask for tips when learning a new technology, but second of all also a resource for external people as a contact page. On our nice-to-have list was also a filter/search-bar and to add something indicating the experience in bytes or number of projects. We also used two smaller API's to generate the profile-pictures and to color-match the bars to that image.",
        challanges: "We came across many problems with the logic of async as the program did not always behave as expected. We also came across an issue with some people having to many languages to fit in the card, we solved that with adding an Other-category adding up all languages below 1%. After being done with our must-haves we went into trying to make a Gatsby-version of the project, but pretty quickly realised that it would be more beneficial to start learning the basics of React instead.",
        learning1: "Better understanding of async and promises",
        learning2: "The importance a safe and encourageing team-culture and how that improves efficiency",
        learning3: "Being a leader is not a bad thing as long as it's done right",

        projectTitle: "Doosti",
        brief: "Create a website based on your classmate's passion company. Base your design upon questions to your friend nailing down what he/she wants the user to feel. Included in the design for the user module - 1.5 day assigment on Hyper Island.",
        time: "1.5 days.",
        goals: "Have a website and design to deliver, practice making fast decisions.",
        role: "This is a solo project completely designed and coded by me. The business idea and copy is created by my classmate, Omid Haqbin.",
        solution: "When asking questions to Omid we discussed the purpose and target audience of the company, which is young adventurous adults in Afghanistan. The business is meant to be a crossing between couchsurfing and tripadvisor and the final purpose is to increase the speed of peace by closing the gap between different ethnic groups in Afghanistan and making young people eager to travel their own country.",
        challanges: "Since this project had to be ready in just 1.5 days the biggest challange was to make decisions fast enough to complete the task, but still making consious and good design decisions to target the right audience and inspire to travel.",
        learning1: "I am able to make fast decisions when needed",
        learning2: "Sometimes good decisions doesn't have to take time",
        learning3: "The paradox of choice - I don't need to try 20 different fonts, 5 is probably enough to make a good decision",
        learning4: "Prototyping takes a lot more time for me than the actual coding",
        learning5: "The power of NUF - Questions. NAIL the scope of the project, UNDERSTAND my role, what do we want the user to FEEL",
